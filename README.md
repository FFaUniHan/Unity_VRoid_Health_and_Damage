# Instructions
Once you download and extract the zip file or clone the project to your Git application, open it in Unity Hub. If you want to follow along the tutorial, use the Before Tutorial folder. But if you just want the final result, use the After Tutorial folder.

This project uses Unity version 2021.2.3f, earlier versions of Unity might not work, and later versions might break some of the scripts. To download a specific version of Unity, go to this website https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. After you download and install the Unity version, you can add this version of Unity back to Unity Hub and open it.
